# TEXTBOOK-PROBLEM--4
Open gen_code.txt which represents the genetic code - the keys are codons and the values are amino acid residues

Use this dict to write a program which will translate the DNA sequence into protein:
- Split the DNAsequence into codons
- Look up the amino acid residue for each codon
- Join all thea mino acids to give protein

How does the program cope with sequence whose length is not multiple of 3? or with a sequence that contains unknown bases?
